### Project Description

Customer segmentation is a vital process in marketing and customer relationship management. By grouping customers based on similar characteristics, businesses can tailor their strategies to meet the needs of different segments. This project employs clustering techniques to analyze customer data and identify distinct segments.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The environment used for developing and documenting the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Datapurifier**: For data report and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms, particularly clustering techniques.

### Data Description

The dataset used in this project includes various features related to customer demographics and purchase behavior. Key attributes include:

-**ID**: Customers' unique identifier

-**Year_Birth**: Customers' birth year

-**Education**: Customers' education level

-**Marital_Status**: Customers' marital status

-**Income**: Customers' yearly household income

-**Kidhome**: Number of children in Customers' household

-**Teenhome**: Number of teenagers in Customers' household

-**Dt_Customers**: Date of Customers' enrollment with the company

-**Recency**: Number of days since Customer's last purchase

-**Complain**: 1 if Customer complained, 0 otherwise

### Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values.
   - Normalizing data to ensure all features contribute equally to the distance calculations in clustering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing distributions of key features.
   - Identifying patterns and correlations among features.

3. **Clustering**:
   - Utilizing the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their attributes.
   - Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.

4. **Results Interpretation**:
   - Analyzing the characteristics of each cluster.
   - Visualizing clusters using scatter plots.

### Results

The project identifies distinct customer segments based on the clustering analysis. Each segment is characterized by unique attributes, which can be leveraged for targeted marketing strategies. Visualizations such as cluster plots and distribution graphs provide insights into the customer base.

### Usage
