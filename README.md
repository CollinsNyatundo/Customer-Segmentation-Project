# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

The Customer Segmentation Project aims to analyze customer data and group customers into segments based on their similarities. By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can develop targeted marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer experiences. This project utilizes a dataset containing customer information and employs unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation.

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to segment customers into meaningful groups based on their characteristics and behaviors. By applying unsupervised learning algorithms, the project seeks to identify patterns and similarities within the customer base, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions and improve customer-centric strategies.

### Key Steps in the Project:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the model's performance.
4. **Model Development**: Building and training various clustering models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
6. **Results Interpretation**: Analyzing the results to derive insights and conclusions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as:

- Customer ID
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income
- Spending Score (1-100)

The dataset provides a starting point for understanding customer characteristics and their relationships with the business.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building and evaluating models.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sci-kit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CollinsNyatundo/Customer-Segmentation-Project.git
   cd Customer-Segmentation-Project
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `Customer-Segmentation-Project.ipynb` file.

3. **Follow the Notebook Cells**:
   Execute each cell sequentially to preprocess the data, perform EDA, engineer features, build models, and evaluate their performance.

## Model Evaluation

The project evaluates multiple clustering algorithms, including:

- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN

The models are assessed using metrics such as silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index. The best-performing model is selected based on these metrics.

## Results and Insights

The customer segmentation analysis provides valuable insights into the customer base. By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can:

- Develop targeted marketing campaigns for each segment
- Offer personalized product recommendations
- Optimize pricing strategies based on customer value
- Enhance customer engagement and loyalty

## Conclusion

The Customer Segmentation Project demonstrates how unsupervised learning techniques can be applied to customer data for effective segmentation. By understanding the unique characteristics of each customer segment, businesses can make data-driven decisions and improve their overall customer-centric strategies.
